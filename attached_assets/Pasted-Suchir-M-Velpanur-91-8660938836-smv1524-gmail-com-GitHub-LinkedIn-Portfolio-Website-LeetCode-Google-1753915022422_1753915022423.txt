WORK EXPERIENCE
Project Intern at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Jan. 2025 - Present
Developed an AI-driven LLM agent framework for automated issue diagnosis in a simple simulated storage system using contextual log analysis & root
cause analysis
Built a Python-based REST API simulator with real time metrics tracking (latency, capacity, saturation) and optional UI for system visualization.
Research Intern at Centre For Information Security, Forensics and Cyber Resilience, PES University Jun. 2024 - Aug 2024
Worked on various applications of AI/ML For Cyber Security in domains such as Digital Forensics, Malware Detection, DDoS Mitigation etc.
Worked on a research paper for studying the use of LLMs for Log Analysis and performance comparisons with LSTMs and Transformers
Backend Engineering Intern at Dyashin Technosoft Pvt Ltd. Jun. 2024 - Jul. 2024
Developed a Banking Database Management System using Java Spring Boot
Used Postman to test API based on HTTP requests
Used AWS EC2 instances to deploy the website
PROJECTS
OptimaSQL : Built an SQL query optimiser that evaluates and visualises alternative execution plans for performance comparison using TPC-H benchmark
data.
Tech used : Flask, React, PostgreSQL, TPC-H dataset, Poetry, Node.js
DiagnoSys Bot : Developed an intelligent assistant agent using LLMs to identify and debug issues in a simple storage system architecture, aiming to
enhance system reliability and reduce downtime through automated root cause analysis.
Tech used : LangChain, LangGraph, Streamlit, REST APIs, Flask, ChromaDB, PyPDF, Pandas, Requests
Multi Agent Music Generation Framework from VAD Scores : Developed a multimodal framework that analyzes both audio and facial imagery to detect
emotional states via Valence, Arousal & Dominance (VAD) scores, & recommends music aligned with the userâ€™s emotional context. The system bypasses
transcription by extracting VAD signals directly from raw inputs and uses emotion-to-music mappings for personalized recommendations.
Tech used : PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, Librosa, Audiocraft, ChromaDB, Streamlit, SpeechRecognition, Pydub Google Generative AI, NumPy
TrafficSync : Developed a real-time 3D traffic simulation that adapts congestion control based on real-time Google Maps data and dynamically adjusting
vehicle flow at a busy Bangalore intersection
Tech used : Three.js, Node.js, Google Maps API, JavaScript, Vercel
EduStream : Implemented an Azure-hosted e-learning platform utilizing Azure App Services and Azure PostgreSQL, designed for easy course uploads
and seamless topic discovery for learners.
Tech used : Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Django, Azure App Services
PseudoKube : Simulated a lightweight Kubernetes-like cluster orchestration framework with pod scheduling using scheduling algorithms (First Fit, Best
Fit, Worst Fit), node health monitoring via heartbeats, and dynamic pod rescheduling for failure recovery
Tech used: Python, FastAPI, Docker, Shell Scripting, Node.js, Git, Unix CLI, Scheduling Algorithms
