Create a modern, CLI-themed developer portfolio website using:

- Next.js (App Router structure)
- Tailwind CSS with Tailwind Typography
- Framer Motion for subtle animations
- Mobile responsive, dark-mode toggle
- Inspired by this layout & style: https://rahul0xcdf-p0rtf0lio.vercel.app

üîß Folder structure:
- Use `/app` directory with clean component structure
- Include reusable layout components for section styling
- Keep design minimal and inspired by terminal CLI (monospace fonts, green/cyan highlights, shadowed blocks)

üß≠ Navigation Sections (with smooth scroll):
> Home  
> About  
> Projects  
> Skills  
> Workshops  
> Contact
